# <Weather API>

## Description

This project was created as a weather forecasting service. It uses an API from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 to show the next five day forecast. I built this project because it allowed me to practice integrating an API and calling it within an application. During the project I learned how to use API routes from an external API. 


## Installation

Run the command "npm i" in the terminal at the root level to install the npm packages for the project

## Usage

The website allows users to search for a city and it displays the weather for the next 5 days in that city.
